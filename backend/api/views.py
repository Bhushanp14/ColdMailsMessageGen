Goal:
Start a casual conversation that makes the business owner curious about getting a website made (or redesigned), without sounding salesy or robotic.

Tone:

Guidelines:
- Avoid buzzwords and formal phrases.
- Make it sound like a human conversation opener.
- Optionally, include a casual call-to-action like ‚Äúwant to take a quick look?‚Äù or ‚Äúhappy to share it if you‚Äôre curious.‚Äù
